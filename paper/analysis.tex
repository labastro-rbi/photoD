Another important degeneracy arises from the fact that even for a fixed \teff and \feh, the \logg and thus the luminosity are not uniquely determined by the colors: a degeneracy may exist between the giant branch and the main sequence as the colors constructed from \textit{ugrizy} bands are not sensitive to \logg.
