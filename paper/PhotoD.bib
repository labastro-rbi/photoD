	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Three-dimensional (3D) maps of the Galactic interstellar matter (ISM) are a potential tool of wide use, but accurate and detailed maps are still lacking. One of the ways to construct the maps is to invert individual distance-limited ISM measurements, a method we have applied here to measurements of stellar color excess in the optical.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We assembled color excess data together with the associated parallax or photometric distances to constitute a catalog of ?23 000 sightlines for stars within 2.5 kpc. The photometric data are taken from Str{\"o}mgren catalogs, the Geneva photometric database, and the Geneva-Copenhagen survey. We also included extinctions derived towards open clusters. We applied an inversion method based on a regularized Bayesian approach to this color excess dataset, a method previously used for mapping at closer distances.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We show the dust spatial distribution resulting from the inversion by means of planar cuts through the differential opacity 3D distribution, and by means of 2D maps of the integrated opacity from the Sun up to various distances. The mapping assigns locations to the nearby dense clouds and represents their distribution at the spatial resolution that is allowed by the dataset properties, i.e. ?10 pc close to the Sun and increasing to ?100 pc beyond 1 kpc. Biases toward nearby and/or weakly extincted stars make this dataset particularly appropriate to mapping the local and neighboring cavities and to locating faint, extended nearby clouds, which are both goals that are difficult or impossible with other mapping methods. The new maps reveal a ?1 kpc wide empty region in the third quadrant in the continuation of the so-called CMa tunnel of the Local Cavity, a cavity that we identify as the Superbubble GSH238+00+09 detected in radio emission maps and that is found to be bounded by the Orion and Vela clouds. The maps also show an extended narrower tunnel in the opposite direction ({\textless}i{\textgreater}l{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ? 70{\textdegree}) that also extends the Local Bubble further and together with it forms a conspicuous cavity bounded by the main Lup, Sco, Oph, Aql, Lac, Cep, and Tau clouds and OB associations. This chain of cavities and surrounding dense regions constitute the first computed representation of the well known Gould belt/Lindblad ring structures. Finally, almost all off-plane faint features that appear in 2D dust maps have a counterpart in the 3D maps, providing the dust distribution in nearby tenuous clouds.},

This map covers the sky north of a decl. of -30{\textdegree}, out to a distance of a few kiloparsecs. This new map contains three major improvements over our previous work. First, the inclusion of Gaia parallaxes dramatically improves distance estimates to nearby stars. Second, we incorporate a spatial prior that correlates the dust density across nearby sightlines. This produces a smoother map, with more isotropic clouds and smaller distance uncertainties, particularly to clouds within the nearest kiloparsec. Third, we infer the dust density with a distance resolution that is four times finer than in our previous work, to accommodate the improvements in signal-to-noise enabled by the other improvements. As part of this work, we infer the distances, reddenings, and types of 799 million stars. (Our 3D dust map can be accessed at doi:10.7910/DVN/2EJ9TX or through the Python package dustmaps, while our catalog of stellar parameters can be accessed at doi:10.7910/DVN/AV9GXO. More information about the map, as well as an interactive viewer, can be found at argonaut.skymaps.info.)

	abstract = {Using the photometric parallax method we estimate the distances to {\textasciitilde}48 million stars detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and map their three-dimensional number density distribution in the Galaxy. The currently available data sample the distance range from 100 pc to 20 kpc and cover 6500 deg2 of sky, mostly at high Galactic latitudes ({\textbar}b{\textbar} {\textgreater} 25). These stellar number density maps allow an investigation of the Galactic structure with no a priori assumptions about the functional form of its components. The data show strong evidence for a Galaxy consisting of an oblate halo, a disk component, and a number of localized overdensities. The number density distribution of stars as traced by M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (D {\textless} 2 kpc) is well fit by two exponential disks (the thin and thick disk) with scale heights and lengths, bias corrected for an assumed 35\% binary fraction, of H1 = 300 pc and L1 = 2600 pc, and H2 = 900 pc and L2 = 3600 pc, and local thick-to-thin disk density normalization $\rho$thick(R?)/$\rho$thin(R?) = 12\% . We use the stars near main-sequence turnoff to measure the shape of the Galactic halo. We find a strong preference for oblate halo models, with best-fit axis ratio c/a = 0.64, $\rho$H propto r-2.8 power-law profile, and the local halo-to-thin disk normalization of 0.5\%. Based on a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate the errors of derived model parameters not to be larger than {\textasciitilde}20\% for the disk scales and {\textasciitilde}10\% for the density normalization, with largest contributions to error coming from the uncertainty in calibration of the photometric parallax relation and poorly constrained binary fraction. While generally consistent with the above model, the measured density distribution shows a number of statistically significant localized deviations. In addition to known features, such as the Monoceros stream, we detect two overdensities in the thick disk region at cylindrical galactocentric radii and heights (R,Z) {\textasciitilde} (6.5,1.5) kpc and (R,Z) {\textasciitilde} (9.5,0.8) kpc and a remarkable density enhancement in the halo covering over 1000 deg2 of sky toward the constellation of Virgo, at distances of {\textasciitilde}6-20 kpc. Compared to counts in a region symmetric with respect to the l = 0{\textdegree} line and with the same Galactic latitude, the Virgo overdensity is responsible for a factor of 2 number density excess and may be a nearby tidal stream or a low-surface brightness dwarf galaxy merging with the Milky Way. The u - g color distribution of stars associated with it implies metallicity lower than that of thick disk stars and consistent with the halo metallicity distribution. After removal of the resolved overdensities, the remaining data are consistent with a smooth density distribution; we detect no evidence of further unresolved clumpy substructure at scales ranging from {\textasciitilde}50 pc in the disk to {\textasciitilde}1-2 kpc in the halo.},

	abstract = {Stellar distances constitute a foundational pillar of astrophysics. The publication of 1.47 billion stellar parallaxes from Gaia is a major contribution to this. Despite Gaia{\textquoteright}s precision, the majority of these stars are so distant or faint that their fractional parallax uncertainties are large, thereby precluding a simple inversion of parallax to provide a distance. Here we take a probabilistic approach to estimating stellar distances that uses a prior constructed from a three-dimensional model of our Galaxy. This model includes interstellar extinction and Gaia{\textquoteright}s variable magnitude limit. We infer two types of distance. The first, geometric, uses the parallax with a direction-dependent prior on distance. The second, photogeometric, additionally uses the color and apparent magnitude of a star, by exploiting the fact that stars of a given color have a restricted range of probable absolute magnitudes (plus extinction). Tests on simulated data and external validations show that the photogeometric estimates generally have higher accuracy and precision for stars with poor parallaxes. We provide a catalog of 1.47 billion geometric and 1.35 billion photogeometric distances together with asymmetric uncertainty measures. Our estimates are quantiles of a posterior probability distribution, so they transform invariably and can therefore also be used directly in the distance modulus (). The catalog may be downloaded or queried using ADQL at various sites (see http://www.mpia.de/ calj/gedr3\_distances.html), where it can also be cross-matched with the Gaia catalog.},

	abstract = {The second Gaia data release (Gaia DR2) contains, beyond the astrometry, three-band photometry for 1.38 billion sources. One band is the G band, the other two were obtained by integrating the Gaia prism spectra (BP and RP). We have used these three broad photometric bands to infer stellar effective temperatures, Teff, for all sources brighter than G = 17 mag with Teff in the range 3000-10 000 K (some 161 million sources). Using in addition the parallaxes, we infer the line-of-sight extinction, AG, and the reddening, E(BP - RP), for 88 million sources. Together with a bolometric correction we derive luminosity and radius for 77 million sources. These quantities as well as their estimated uncertainties are part of Gaia DR2. Here we describe the procedures by which these quantities were obtained, including the underlying assumptions, comparison with literature estimates, and the limitations of our results. Typical accuracies are of order 324 K (Teff), 0.46 mag (AG), 0.23 mag (E(BP - RP)), 15\% (luminosity), and 10\% (radius). Being based on only a small number of observable quantities and limited training data, our results are necessarily subject to some extreme assumptions that can lead to strong systematics in some cases (not included in the aforementioned accuracy estimates). One aspect is the non-negativity contraint of our estimates, in particular extinction, which we discuss. Yet in several regions of parameter space our results show very good performance, for example for red clump stars and solar analogues. Large uncertainties render the extinctions less useful at the individual star level, but they show good performance for ensemble estimates. We identify regimes in which our parameters should and should not be used and we define a "clean" sample. Despite the limitations, this is the largest catalogue of uniformly-inferred stellar parameters to date. More precise and detailed astrophysical parameters based on the full BP/RP spectrophotometry are planned as part of the third Gaia data release.},

The map has a hybrid angular resolution, with most of the map at an angular resolution of {\textendash}, and a maximum distance resolution of . The three-dimensional distribution of dust is determined in a fully probabilistic framework, yielding the uncertainty in the reddening distribution along each line of sight, as well as stellar distances, reddenings, and classifications for 800 million stars detected by PS1. We demonstrate the consistency of our reddening estimates with those of two-dimensional emission-based maps of dust reddening. In particular, we find agreement with the Planck -based reddening map to within in to a depth of , and explore systematics at reddenings less than . We validate our per-star reddening estimates by comparison with reddening estimates for stars with both Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry and Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration spectral classifications, finding per-star agreement to within out to a stellar of 1 mag. We compare our map to two existing three-dimensional dust maps, by Marshall et al. and Lallement et al., demonstrating our finer angular resolution, and better distance resolution compared to the former within .

Here, we present several updates to our spectrophotometric distance code, which can now also be used to estimate ages, masses, and extinctions for individual stars. Given a set of measured spectrophotometric parameters, we calculate the posterior probability distribution over a given grid of stellar evolutionary models, using flexible Galactic stellar-population priors. The code (called StarHorse) can accommodate different observational data sets, prior options, partially missing data, and the inclusion of parallax information into the estimated probabilities. We validate the code using a variety of simulated stars as well as real stars with parameters determined from asteroseismology, eclipsing binaries, and isochrone fits to star clusters. Our main goal in this validation process is to test the applicability of the code to field stars with known Gaia-like parallaxes. The typical internal precisions (obtained from realistic simulations of an APOGEE+Gaia-like sample) are \{\~{}eq \} 8 \{per cent\} in distance, \{\~{}eq \} 20 \{per cent\} in age, \{\~{}eq \} 6 \{per cent\} in mass, and ? 0.04 mag in AV. The median external precision (derived from comparisons with earlier work for real stars) varies with the sample used, but lies in the range of \{\~{}eq \} [0,2] \{per cent\} for distances, \{\~{}eq \} [12,31] \{per cent\} for ages, \{\~{}eq \} [4,12] \{per cent\} for masses, and ? 0.07 mag for AV.

The BEAST is specifically formulated for use with large multi-band surveys of resolved stellar populations. Our approach accounts for measurement uncertainties and any covariance between them due to stellar crowding (both systematic biases and uncertainties in the bias) and absolute flux calibration, thereby incorporating the full information content of the measurement.

Using a subsample of 23 million stars with Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) photometry, whose addition enables more robust results, we show that SDSS photometry alone is sufficient to break degeneracies between intrinsic stellar color and dust amount when the shape of extinction curve is fixed. When using both SDSS and 2MASS photometry, the ratio of the total to selective absorption, RV , can be determined with an uncertainty of about 0.1 for most stars in high-extinction regions. These fits enable detailed studies of the dust properties and its spatial distribution, and of the stellar spatial distribution at low Galactic latitudes ({\textbar}b{\textbar} {\textless} 30{\textdegree}). Our results are in good agreement with the extinction normalization given by the Schlegel et al. (SFD) dust maps at high northern Galactic latitudes, but indicate that the SFD extinction map appears to be consistently overestimated by about 20\% in the southern sky, in agreement with recent study by Schlafly et al. The constraints on the shape of the dust extinction curve across the SDSS and 2MASS bandpasses disfavor the reddening law of O'Donnell, but support the models by Fitzpatrick and Cardelli et al. For the latter, we find a ratio of the total to selective absorption to be RV = 3.0 {\textpm} 0.1(random){\textpm}0.1 (systematic) over most of the high-latitude sky. At low Galactic latitudes ({\textbar}b{\textbar} {\textless} 5{\textdegree}), we demonstrate that the SFD map cannot be reliably used to correct for extinction because most stars are embedded in dust, rather than behind it, as is the case at high Galactic latitudes. We analyze three-dimensional maps of the best-fit RV and find that RV = 3.1 cannot be ruled out in any of the 10 SEGUE stripes at a precision level of {\textasciitilde}0.1-0.2. Our best estimate for the intrinsic scatter of RV in the regions probed by SEGUE stripes is {\textasciitilde}0.2. We introduce a method for efficient selection of candidate red giant stars in the disk, dubbed "dusty parallax relation," which utilizes a correlation between distance and the extinction along the line of sight. We make these best-fit parameters, as well as all the input SDSS and 2MASS data, publicly available in a user-friendly format. These data can be used for studies of stellar number density distribution, the distribution of dust properties, for selecting sources whose SED differs from SEDs for high-latitude main-sequence stars, and for estimating distances to dust clouds and, in turn, to molecular gas clouds.},

	abstract = {We present the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST), a probabilistic approach to modeling the dust extinguished photometric spectral energy distribution of an individual star while accounting for observational uncertainties common to large resolved star surveys. Given a set of photometric measurements and an observational uncertainty model, the BEAST infers the physical properties of the stellar source using stellar evolution and atmosphere models and constrains the line of sight extinction using a newly developed mixture model that encompasses the full range of dust extinction curves seen in the Local Group. The BEAST is specifically formulated for use with large multi-band surveys of resolved stellar populations. Our approach accounts for measurement uncertainties and any covariance between them due to stellar crowding (both systematic biases and uncertainties in the bias) and absolute flux calibration, thereby incorporating the full information content of the measurement. We illustrate the accuracy and precision possible with the BEAST using data from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury. While the BEAST has been developed for this survey, it can be easily applied to similar existing and planned resolved star surveys. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	abstract = {We describe TRILEGAL, a new populations synthesis code for simulating the stellar photometry of any Galaxy field. The code attempts to improve upon several technical aspects of star count models, by: dealing with very complete input libraries of evolutionary tracks; using a stellar spectral library to simulate the photometry in virtually any broad-band system; being very versatile allowing easy changes in the input libraries and in the description of all of its ingredients - like the star formation rate, age-metallicity relation, initial mass function, and geometry of Galaxy components. In a previous paper (Groenewegen et al. 2002, Paper I), the code was first applied to describe the very deep star counts of the CDFS stellar catalogue. Here, we briefly describe its initial calibration using EIS-deep and DMS star counts, which, as we show, are adequate samples to probe both the halo and the disc components of largest scale heights (oldest ages). We then present the changes in the calibration that were necessary to cope with some improvements in the model input data, and the use of more extensive photometry datasets: now the code is shown to successfully simulate also the relatively shallower 2MASS catalogue, which probes mostly the disc at intermediate ages, and the immediate solar neighbourhood as sampled by Hipparcos - in particular its absolute magnitude versus colour diagram -, which contains a somewhat larger fraction of younger stars than deeper surveys. Remarkably, the same model calibration can reproduce well the star counts in all the above-mentioned data sets, that span from the very deep magnitudes of CDFS (16},

The simulation is based on the TRILEGAL code, which resorts to large databases of stellar evolutionary tracks, synthetic spectra, and pulsation models, added to simple prescriptions for the stellar density and star formation histories of the main structures of the Galaxy, to generate mock stellar samples through a population synthesis approach. The main bodies of the Magellanic Clouds are also included. A complete simulation is provided for single stars, down to the r = 27.5 mag depth of the coadded Wide-Fast-Deep survey images. A second simulation is provided for a fraction of the binaries, including the interacting ones, as derived with the BinaPSE module of TRILEGAL. We illustrate the main properties and numbers derived from these simulations, including: comparisons with real star counts; the expected numbers of Cepheids, long-period variables, and eclipsing binaries; the crowding limits as a function of seeing and filter; the star-to-galaxy ratios. Complete catalogs are accessible through the NOIRLab Astro Data Lab, while the stellar density maps are incorporated in the LSST metrics analysis framework.},

	abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 $\mu$m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 $\mu$m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 $\mu$m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 $\mu$m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 $\mu$m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 $\mu$m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 $\mu$m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 $\mu$m (95\% confidence). This integrated flux {\textasciitilde}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 $\mu$m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},
