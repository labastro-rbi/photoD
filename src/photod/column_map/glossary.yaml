- id: MrBright
  description: >-
    (context of priors) brightness allowed absolute magnitude in r
    band. Brightest is having lowest magnitude.
- id: MrFaint
  description: >-
    Opposite of MrBright.
- prefix: M
  description: >-
    as in capital “M” usually denotes an absolute magnitude. Apparent
    magnitude <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude> that
    the object would have if it were viewed from a distance of exactly
    10 parsecs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec> (32.6
    light-years), without extinction
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(astronomy)> (or
    dimming) of its light due to absorption by interstellar matter
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium> and cosmic
    dust <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust>.
