# Capturing the IDs, prefixes, and suffixes as given.

- column_id: MrBright
  description: >-
    (context of priors) brightness allowed absolute magnitude in r
    band. Brightest is having lowest magnitude.
- column_id: MrFaint
  description: >-
    Opposite of MrBright.
- prefix: M
  description: >-
    as in capital “M” usually denotes an absolute magnitude. Apparent
    magnitude <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude> that
    the object would have if it were viewed from a distance of exactly
    10 parsecs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec> (32.6
    light-years), without extinction
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(astronomy)> (or
    dimming) of its light due to absorption by interstellar matter
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium> and cosmic
    dust <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust>.
- prefix: m
  description: >-
    usually denotes an apparent/observed magnitude.
- suffix: Min
  description: minimum
- suffix: Max
  description: maximum
- column_id: MrNpts
  description: >-
    Number of stars with a unique value of Mr in locusData. Defines
    the grid step for Mr.
- column_id: rmagBinWidth
  description: bin width of the observed magnitude in the r band
- column_id: rmagNsteps
  description: number of steps in r mag
- prefix: rmag
  description: observed magnitude in the r band
- column_id: SGB
  description: sub-giant branch
- column_id: RGB
  description: red giant branch
- column_id: CHeB
  description: core helium burning phase
- column_id: AGB
  description: asymptotic giant branch
- column_id: EAGB
  description: early asymptotic giant branch
- column_id: TP-AGB
  description: thermally pulsing AGB
- column_id: PAGB
  description: >-
    the phase between the Asymptotic Giant Branch phase and the White
    Dwarf phases, when outer layers (shells) of a 0.8-8 solar-mass
    star are shed, a planetary nebula is formed and hot, compact
    remnant of the original star is revealed.
- column_id: WD
  description: white dwarfs
- suffix: dS
  description: drop in entropy
- suffix: EstUnc
  description: >-
    estimated uncertainty as a +/- delta for the quantity it modifies (confidence interval)
